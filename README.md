Home security system 
The need for home security alarm systems nowadays is a serious demand. As the 

number of crimes are increasing every day, there has to be something that will 

keep us safe. We are all aware of the high-end security systems present in the 

market but they are not easily available to everyone. We therefore intend to 

provide a soluƟon by construcƟng a cost-efficient electronic system that has the 

capability of sensing the moƟon of the intruders and seƫng off the alarm. The 

basic idea behind this project is that all the bodies generate some heat energy 

in the form of infrared which is invisible to human eyes. But, it can be detected 

by electronic moƟon sensor.

The project involves the use of Arduino, moƟon sensor, buzzer, WiFi, Bluetooth 

and a simple program . The sensor detect any moƟon in its permissible range 

and triggers the alarm, Bluetooth is use for car. 

It will also send the signal to Arduino which processes the signal and set off the 

alarm along with detecƟon message on display. With this system we can easily 

set up a security in our home for unwanted intruders
